 * This header provides a centralized include point for all audio feature extraction
 * functionality. It groups the features into three main categories:
 * - Time-domain features: Statistical measures computed directly from audio samples
 * - Spectral-domain features: Measures computed from frequency-domain representations
 * - Sample-level features: Features computed on individual samples rather than blocks
